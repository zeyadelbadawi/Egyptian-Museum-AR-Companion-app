# Egyptian-Museum-AR-Companion-app


Tech Fusion: Flutter, Unity, Object Detection

Experience history like never before with our graduation project, the "Egyptian Museum AR Companion App." Using Flutter, Unity, and Object Detection, We've crafted an interactive mobile app for seamless museum exploration.

Indoor Navigation: Unity-powered virtual guiding lines lead you effortlessly to chosen exhibits.

Object Detection: Point your device, unlock artifact stories, and dive deep into history.

Beyond the Museum: Dive into comprehensive info pages and locate artifacts on Google Maps.

Future Vision: Our vision for this app extends beyond its initial features. In the future, we plan to incorporate exciting Game Development elements. Users will be in interactive challenges, where virtual coins are scattered throughout the museum. Upon collecting a predetermined number of coins, tourists will get gifts and exclusive vouchers to indulge in a shopping spree at the Museum Bazaar.Tech Fusion: Flutter, Unity, Object Detection Experience history like never before with our graduation project, the "Egyptian Museum AR Companion App." Using Flutter, Unity, and Object Detection, We've crafted an interactive mobile app for seamless museum exploration.
